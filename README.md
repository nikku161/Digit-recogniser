MNIST Digit Recognition Project
This project is a robust implementation of a digit recognition system that uses the MNIST dataset, a collection of handwritten digits ranging from 0-9. The objective is to classify a given image of a handwritten digit into one of the 10 classes representing 0-9. The system uses Machine Learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks, to train and test the model. Features include data preprocessing, model creation, training and evaluation, and user interaction for digit prediction. The project strives for high accuracy and efficiency, providing an intuitive way to recognize and interpret handwritten digits automatically. Please refer to the installation guide and documentation for more details on how to set up and use this project.
